# crypto-price-tracker
This project contains two versions of a Python script that fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices using the CoinMarketCap API. The script allows users to track the price of a selected coin by symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH), and optionally receive notifications at a specified interval.
